'''Problem Statement: "Inheriting and Extending Animal Behaviors"
Problem

You are given a base class Animal with a constructor that takes one argument, name, and stores it as an instance attribute. Create the following subclasses that inherit from Animal:

Dog:

Inherits the Animal class.
Add an attribute breed to store the dogâ€™s breed.
Modify the constructor to take an additional argument breed.
Implement a method fetch() that takes one argument thing and prints: "[name] the [breed] goes after the [thing]".
Cat:

Inherits the Animal class.
Add an attribute lives_left which defaults to 9 if not specified.
Implement a method meow() that prints: "[name] says 'Meow!'".
Implement a method lose_life() which decreases lives_left by 1 and prints the number of lives left. If lives_left is already 0, print: "[name] has no lives left.".
Bird:

Inherits the Animal class.
Add an attribute can_fly that is True by default but can be set to False when creating the instance.
Implement a method fly() that prints: "[name] flies in the sky." if can_fly is True. Otherwise, it should print: "[name] can't fly.".

# Testing
dog = Dog("Buddy", "Golden Retriever")
cat = Cat("Whiskers")
bird = Bird("Polly", can_fly=False)

dog.fetch("ball")
cat.meow()
cat.lose_life()
bird.fly()
